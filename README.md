# WOWH remaster

The original 3rd-party WOWH map, remastered.\
WOWH means World of Warriors of Hell. Warriors of Hell was a German guild of Diablo II players.

## What I did

This map is re-buildable and editable. I opened & saved every region in Siege Editor v1.7. The dsmap file can be rebuilt using the batch scripts, provided you have the folder structure of Dungeon Siege, TankCreator and gaspy.
- SE saves the "required_level" attributes for multiplayer start positions with an "i" in front, which however breaks the level requirement.\
  This is fixed during build by a gaspy script.

## Attribution

This map was created by the "Warriors of Hell" guild of Diablo II players, not me. I'm just doing minor changes here.
